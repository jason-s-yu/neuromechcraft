"""
Now suppose we want to extend the FOV from one cam (which provides horizontal FOV of about 103 degrees).

We can use 4 cameras to cover >360 degrees of view (about 430)
and then stitch them together to produce the 17 degree front middle overlap, 
ignoring the excess ~100 degrees on the rear.

We can do this by commanding the agent to turn, capture the observation frames, and then stitch them together.

This is obviously not ideal as far as real time processing goes (there could be noticeable input delay)
because the agent has to turn and capture 4 distinct frames nearly instantaneously.
